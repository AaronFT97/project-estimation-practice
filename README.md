# ⏱️ Project Estimation Practice

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to this practice repository.

The entire purpose of this repo is to serve as a sandbox for **practicing time estimations** on development tasks.

---

## 🎯 Origin

This repository was created as a guided exercise with **Google Gemini**. It's designed to be a hands-on environment to practice the skills I learned from **Platzi's Git/GitHub course**.

## 📂 What's Inside?

This repo is intentionally simple and includes:

* `README.md` (You're reading it!)
* A few other files that simulate a basic website.

You can use this repo's **Issues** and **Projects** tabs to create practice tasks, assign estimates, and track your progress.
